                Born in Porto, Portugal, I´ve always been following amd investing the arts as a part of my being.<br />I
                am now enrolled in the Design Course at the University of Aveiro, which I joined back in 2020 with the
                ambition to experiment with the different paths Design has to offer, from the product to interactive,
                communication, services, and typography areas.

                During these two years, it’s been clear to me that Interior Deisgn is my right path, and I look forward
                to experimenting in this new field of knowledge, once I get the opportunity.<br />I´ve realized that I´m
                the happiest when I imagine people relying on me because they trust my aesthethic, taste, and skills as
                my job.<br />I strongly believe as Designer we should always stand somewhere out of our comfort zone,
                and as an ERASMUS student, I hope to expand my horizons and looks for new answers outside the Portuguese
                Design context, in order to grow as a Designer but also as an individual.
